# TuringMillionaire
ICS2U3 Final Project: Who Wants to be a Millionaire but in Turing. 

Final Mark: 94%

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

This game was written entirely in Turing! Turing is a beginner programming language that is used in Ontario, Canada, to teach high school students how to program. It is only taught in the first intro course to computer programmming and is completely useless in the current day. The code is surprisingly readable, with adequate commenting. The questions are stored in a 3d array - 3 questions for each of the 15 difficulties, and 5 indices for each question {q,a1,a2,a3,a4}. 

<h2>Art and Music</h2>

Most art is original and created with Fire Alpaca, a drawing software, except for <i>backdrop.jpg, background.jpg, logo.jpg and menupic.jpg.</i> Did I mention that Turing does not support .PNG files?

The song played in the background is the main theme for the original <i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</i> show and is composed and produced by Cole Porter. I do not own this song and all rights go to the original artist. This project is not monetized so I should be safe from the copyright hammer.
